# beaconjsonexporter

Production Collector exporter for Beacon Endpoint Agent.

This exporter is built into the custom `beacon-otelcol` distribution. It is
responsible for converting OTLP logs, traces, metrics, and resource attributes
into Wazuh-compatible Beacon endpoint JSONL events.

Required behavior:

- Bind only through Collector receivers configured on localhost.
- Write one complete JSON object per line.
- Use the canonical `vendor=beacon`, `product=endpoint-agent`,
  `schema_version=1.0` event contract.
- Identify Claude Cowork OTLP resources and map prompts, tool/MCP calls, file
  access, approval decisions, API usage, token counts, costs, and errors into
  Beacon endpoint events.
- Include configured content fields by default, with `metadata` and `redacted`
  modes available for stricter deployments.
- Redact common secrets and cap event size before writing.
- Emit health failure events when write failures occur.

Noise controls:

- Generic process/runtime metrics are dropped by default unless
  `include_runtime_metrics: true` is set.
- Codex spans are dropped by default because Codex semantic logs carry the
  endpoint activity Beacon needs. Set `include_codex_spans: true` only when
  troubleshooting Codex OTLP internals.
- Codex metrics and transport/startup/debug logs remain suppressed by default so
  one prompt does not flood the endpoint runtime log.
- Copilot CLI operational metrics (`github.copilot.*`, legacy
  `copilot_chat.*`) are suppressed by default; only
  `gen_ai.client.token.usage` and `gen_ai.client.operation.duration` are kept.
  Activity comes from OTLP spans. Set `include_runtime_metrics: true` for
  troubleshooting.

The production implementation should live here and be included by
`collector-builder/builder.yaml`.
