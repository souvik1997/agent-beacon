# Beacon Endpoint Agent AWS CloudWatch Logs Pack

This pack forwards Beacon endpoint JSONL events into AWS CloudWatch Logs. Beacon
still writes one local source of truth: `runtime.jsonl`. AWS credentials,
profiles, IAM roles, log groups, retention settings, and encryption stay in AWS,
Vector, or customer-managed deployment tooling, not in Beacon endpoint
configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Beacon endpoint installed and writing local JSONL.
- An AWS CloudWatch Logs log group for Beacon runtime logs.
- An IAM role or credentials available through the standard AWS credential
  provider chain for the process running Vector.

Recommended log group and stream layout:

```text
/aws/beacon/runtime
beacon-runtime/<hostname>
```

Example least-privilege IAM policy for a pre-created log group:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:/aws/beacon/runtime:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add `logs:CreateLogGroup`, KMS permissions, or account-specific conditions only
if your AWS controls require them. Configure CloudWatch Logs retention, log group
encryption, subscription filters, exports, and access policies in AWS.

## Install

Generate this pack:

```bash
beacon endpoint cloudwatch install-pack --output ./beacon-cloudwatch-pack
```

The generated `vector.toml` points at the Beacon log path selected by the CLI:

- User mode: `~/.beacon/endpoint/logs/runtime.jsonl`
- System mode: `/var/log/beacon-agent/runtime.jsonl`
- Custom mode: the value passed with `--log-path`

For MDM or managed endpoint deployment, prefer Beacon system mode so your
customer-managed log shipper can tail `/var/log/beacon-agent/runtime.jsonl`
without per-user home directory ACLs.

## Production Forwarding

Use the generated Vector config as a customer-managed host-agent forwarding
template. Beacon remains the local JSONL producer; Vector tails `runtime.jsonl`,
checkpoints file offsets in its `data_dir`, batches Beacon events, and writes
JSON log events into AWS CloudWatch Logs.

Install Vector using your normal endpoint management tooling, then copy the
generated config into Vector's config directory. On a macOS system-mode Beacon
deployment, the generated config tails `/var/log/beacon-agent/runtime.jsonl`:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/vector
sudo cp ./beacon-cloudwatch-pack/vector.toml /etc/vector/beacon-cloudwatch.toml
export BEACON_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP="/aws/beacon/runtime"
export BEACON_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_STREAM_PREFIX="beacon-runtime"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
vector validate /etc/vector/beacon-cloudwatch.toml
vector --config /etc/vector/beacon-cloudwatch.toml
```

In managed deployments, provide `BEACON_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP`, optional
`BEACON_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_STREAM_PREFIX`, `AWS_REGION`, and any AWS
credential-provider settings through the Vector service environment, host
identity, or MDM/secret tooling. Do not store AWS destination secrets in Beacon
endpoint configuration.

The Vector template is intentionally simple and expects a Vector version with
the `file` source, `remap` transform, and `aws_cloudwatch_logs` sink. It parses
each Beacon JSONL line and re-encodes the original Beacon event as a JSON
CloudWatch Logs event, without a Vector wrapper.

If you adapt the config or use another forwarder, it should:

- checkpoint file offsets,
- batch JSON records,
- use host-specific log streams,
- retry transient failures without duplicating the whole file,
- keep AWS credentials, IAM roles, log group retention, and encryption outside
  Beacon endpoint configuration.

## Validate

Write a fresh Beacon validation event:

```bash
beacon endpoint cloudwatch validate
```

Wait for your production forwarder to ship the new line. Beacon can write the
local validation event, but remote delivery must be confirmed with AWS tooling:

```bash
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name "$BEACON_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP" \
  --filter-pattern '"Beacon endpoint AWS CloudWatch Logs validation event"' \
  --region "$AWS_REGION"
```

CloudWatch Logs Insights query:

```sql
fields @timestamp, vendor, product, destination.type, destination.mode, message
| filter message like /Beacon endpoint AWS CloudWatch Logs validation event/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

Expected validation fields:

```text
vendor=beacon product=endpoint-agent destination.type=cloudwatch destination.mode=aws_cloudwatch_logs
```

## Content Handling

Beacon forwards retained prompt text, tool input, command output, raw tool
payloads, and related local telemetry to AWS CloudWatch Logs subject to Beacon's
secret redaction, sanitization, truncation, and event-size limits.
