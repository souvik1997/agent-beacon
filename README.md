## What Is Beacon?

Beacon is [Asymptote's open-source endpoint agent](https://justindsouza.substack.com/p/introducing-beacon-endpoint-telemetry) for security and IT teams that
need visibility into local AI agent activity.

It runs locally, captures supported activity from local agent harnesses like
Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Factory Droid, Claude Cowork, and Cursor, then
normalizes that activity into endpoint events your team can inspect and retain
locally.

Beacon is built to be easy to deploy for Security and IT teams through
[MDM deployment](https://docs.asymptotelabs.ai/cli/security-it-teams) and to
connect to Wazuh, Elastic, Splunk HEC, or customer-managed SIEM pipelines, while
remaining visibility-first and local-first during normal endpoint collection.

## High-Level Architecture

Beacon keeps collection, processing, and inspection local to the endpoint while
leaving forwarding under customer control.

</p>

- **Agent runtime layer:** Local hooks and OpenTelemetry sources capture
  supported activity from AI agent harnesses on the endpoint.
- **Beacon endpoint layer:** Local processing normalizes events, applies
  retention and redaction settings, and writes durable endpoint telemetry.
- **Output layer:** Teams inspect events in the local dashboard, retain JSONL,
  or forward records into Wazuh, Elastic, Splunk HEC, and customer-managed SIEM
  pipelines.

Beacon filters generic process and runtime metrics, such as Node.js event loop,
V8 heap, process CPU, and process memory telemetry, out of the local endpoint
JSONL by default so agent prompts, tools, approvals, and file activity remain
easy to inspect. Advanced deployments can opt back into those low-level OTLP
metrics with `beacon endpoint install --include-runtime-metrics` or
`beacon endpoint repair --include-runtime-metrics`.

## Dashboard

Beacon includes a local, read-only dashboard for validating endpoint activity
without a hosted backend. The overview screen summarizes recent runtime events
and collection status, while log search helps teams inspect normalized event
records during rollout, testing, and investigations.

## Elastic

Beacon ships an Elastic content pack for teams that want to search endpoint
events in Elasticsearch and Kibana without giving Beacon cluster credentials.
The pack tails the same local `runtime.jsonl` file with Filebeat or standalone
Elastic Agent, installs ECS-oriented templates and an ingest pipeline, and
includes starter Kibana assets.

```bash
beacon endpoint elastic install-pack --output ./beacon-elastic-pack
beacon endpoint elastic up --pack-dir ./beacon-elastic-pack
```

The local stack binds Elasticsearch and Kibana to loopback. Existing self-managed
or Elastic Cloud deployments can use the same pack by pointing Filebeat at their
cluster with `ES_HOSTS` and `ES_API_KEY`.

## Quickstart

See the [Quickstart](https://docs.asymptotelabs.ai/cli/quickstart) docs for the
full setup paths.

### For Security & IT Teams

Start with the
[security and IT quickstart](https://docs.asymptotelabs.ai/cli/quickstart) and
[managed deployment guidance](https://docs.asymptotelabs.ai/cli/security-it-teams)
for rollout, validation, retention, and SIEM forwarding.

### For Developers

Install the released Beacon CLI locally with Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap asymptote-labs/tap
brew install beacon
beacon version
```

Or build from source:

```bash
cd cli/beacon
make build
```
