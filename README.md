## What is Agent Beacon

Agent Beacon is the world's first [open-source telemetry layer](https://justindsouza.substack.com/p/introducing-beacon-endpoint-telemetry) for AI agents wherever they run: locally, in CI, or in the cloud.

Beacon started with local endpoint telemetry for security and IT teams that need visibility into AI agent activity on employee machines. It now captures supported runtime activity across local agents, CI agents, and cloud agents, then normalizes that activity into events your team can inspect, retain, and forward under your control.

Beacon is built to be easy to deploy for Security and IT teams through
[MDM deployment](#mdm-deployment), CI workflows, and cloud-agent setup paths, and to
emit agent harness telemetry logs to
[all the major enterprise-grade SIEMs](#siem--output-destinations).

Learn more in the [Agent Beacon Documentation](https://docs.asymptotelabs.ai).

## High-Level Architecture

Beacon keeps endpoint collection, processing, and inspection local by default,
while extending the same normalized event model to CI and cloud-agent telemetry
paths under customer control.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/beacon-architecture.png" alt="Beacon endpoint architecture" width="860">
</p>

- **Agent runtime layer:** Hooks, OpenTelemetry sources, CI wrappers, and SDKs
  capture supported activity from AI agent harnesses wherever they run.
- **Beacon endpoint layer:** Local processing normalizes events, applies
  retention and redaction settings, and writes durable endpoint telemetry.
- **Output layer:** Teams inspect events in the local dashboard, retain JSONL,
  or forward records into all the major enterprise-grade SIEMs.

## Supported Surfaces

Beacon captures supported agent harness activity across local endpoints, CI
jobs, and cloud-agent surfaces, then writes normalized events that teams can
inspect in place or forward into customer-managed security pipelines.

## Dashboard

Beacon includes a local, read-only dashboard for validating endpoint activity
without a hosted backend. The overview screen summarizes recent runtime events
and collection status, while log search helps teams inspect normalized event
records during rollout, testing, and investigations.

Beacon writes endpoint activity to a stable local `runtime.jsonl` file. The
active file rotates at 10 MiB with five numbered local archives, keeping the
endpoint handoff file bounded while external SIEM forwarders continue tailing
the active path. The dashboard reads the active log plus retained numbered
archives for local triage; SIEM destinations remain the source of truth for
long-term retention and search.
